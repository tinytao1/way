        The Master gives himself up<br>
        to whatever the moment brings.<br>
        He knows that he is going to die,<br>
        and he has nothing left to hold on to:<br>
        no illusions in his mind,<br>
        no resistances in his body.<br><br>

        He doesn't think about his actions;<br>
        they flow from the core of his being.<br>
        He holds nothing back from life;<br>
        therefore he is ready for death,<br>
        as someone who is ready for sleep<br>
        after a good day's work.<br>

    RETURNING TO THE ROOT</div> <br><br>
    <div class='text'>
        Be completely empty.<br>
        Be perfectly serene.<br>
        The ten thousand things<br>
        arise together: in their<br>
        arising is their return.<br>
        Now they flower,<br>
        and flowering sink homeward<br>
        returning to the root.<br><br>

        The return to the root is<br>
        peace. Peace: to accept<br>
        what must be,<br>
        to know what endures.<br>
        ... following the Tao,<br>
        the way endures forever.<br>
        The body comes to its ending,<br>
        but there is<br>
        nothing to fear.<br>

        Therefore <br>
        the sage <br>
        is devoted <br>
        to non-action ...<br><br>
        Leads people away<br>
        from knowing &<br>
        wanting...<br>
        Practices non-action<br>
        & the natural order<br>
        stays.<br><br>

        Tao Te Ching, <br>
        translation copyright &#169;1998 by Stephen Mitchell<br><br>
        
        from Introduction:<br>
        "...The right stroke or the right movement happens by itself,<br>
        effortlessly, without any interference of the conscious will.<br>
        This is a paradigm for non-action: the purest and most effective<br>
        form of action. The game plays the game; the poem writes the poem;<br>
        we can't tell the dancer from the dance.<br>
        Less and less do you need to force things,<br>
        until finally you arrive at non-action.<br>
        When nothing is done, nothing is left undone.<br>
        Nothing is done because the doer has wholeheartedly<br>
        vanished into the deed; the fuel has been completely<br>
        transformed into flame. This "nothing" is, in fact,<br>
        everything. It happens when we trust the intelligence<br>
        of the universe in the same way that an athlete or a<br>
        dancer trusts the superior intelligence of the body."<br><br>

    Attain complete emptiness,<br>
